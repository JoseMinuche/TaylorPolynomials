<h1 align="center">Taylor polynomial</h1>

Here’s an algorithm in python in which we’ll be able to calculate the Taylor Polynomial of an equation.

It works on python.

Before you run it, you must have numpy, sympy, and matplotlib installed.

You can do it in your command prompt using

```
pip3 install sympy
```

```
pip3 install numpy
```

```
pip3 install python-pip

pip3 install matplotlib
```

Also you can do it in Linux Shell

```
sudo apt install python3-numpy
```

```
sudo apt install python3-sympy
```

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo pip install matplotlib
```

Once you have the libraries, you must be able to run the program!

Please be sure to know the theory of Taylor Polynomials first!
